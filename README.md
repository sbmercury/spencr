This is a very simple implementation of a URL shortener using a domain that I own, spencr.me. It's fully functional and allows the user to quickly add or update shortcodes that point to a full domain. The full version can be used at spencr.me

This app uses:

NodeJS/Express

MongoDB (for storing shortcodes)


My personal version uses Jenkins to automatically deploy changes to a DigitalOcean VPS that it's hosted on.
